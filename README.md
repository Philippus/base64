# base64

> the 64th base of rfc4648

## why

Chances are you probably need a base64 codec.

Chances are you probably don't need everything that came with the library you use to base64 encode data.

This library aims to only do one thing. base64 _. That's it.

A seconday goal was to fully understand [rfc4648](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4648.txt) from first principals. Implementation is a good learning tool. You should try it.
